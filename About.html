                <p>Pathways to Belonging is a free summer program designed to provide kids and teens with a unique opportunity to grow, connect, and thrive through outdoor activities and creative experiences. Our program runs weekly on Mondays, with some special Wednesday sessions, offering a safe and inclusive environment where children ages 6-17 can build friendships, develop new skills, and create lasting memories.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From sports and games to arts and crafts, Pathways to Belonging offers a variety of activities that encourage teamwork, creativity, and physical fitness. Each session is designed to engage kids in meaningful ways, fostering a sense of belonging and confidence in a fun, supportive atmosphere.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At Pathways to Belonging, we believe that every child deserves a chance to experience the joy of summer, while learning valuable life skills that go beyond the playground. Whether they're working together in a team challenge, expressing their creativity through art, or simply enjoying the great outdoors, your child will leave each session feeling empowered, inspired, and part of something special.</p>
